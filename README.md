# Beautiful Jekyll source code

This is the source code of Beautiful Jekyll that is responsible for generating [the demo website for this theme](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll).  To learn how to build a similarly awesome looking website in minutes, go to the [main Beautiful Jekyll page](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme).

**Important note:** This is the `gh-pages` branch of Beautiful Jekyll. If you want to create a User Page (meaning that your website will be `https://yourusername.github.io`) then you should use the `master` branch. If you want to create a Project Page (your website will be `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame`) then you do need to use a `gh-pages` branch, but I strongly suggest you delete this branch and create it again from the `master` branch. This branch in its current form does not include the latest Beautiful Jekyll code, so I recommend you use the `master` branch as the basis of your website.
